## Intro

Cannot create a quarto reveal.js slide with an image only (**no title** and **no text**). 

Instead of showing an image-only page, it will show no page at all.

It will not show an empty page.

Note in the slides below I use `##` to delineate pages rather than a horizontal rule (`---`). The horizontal rule seems to get confused with yaml so `##` seems safer.

There are slight differences in behavior between `##` and `---`. The former will allow a blank page with no title or image, while the latter will not allow a blank page at all. EDITED: Not sure about this. Behavior may be the same, except that `---` does seem to get confused with yaml.

## Image appears properly on a slide with a title

Image appears properly on an **untitled** page **if the untitled page has text** (this line):

But image does not appear on an untitled page that does not have any text (the next page should be an image-only page but instead we go straight to the workaround slide.).

## Workarounds?

Does putting a line with spaces before the image work? If so, there should be an image-only page right after this.

No. There should be an image-only page before this one.


Does putting a comment after the image reference work? If so, there should be an image-only page right after this.

Yes, putting a comment after the image reference works.
