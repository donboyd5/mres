# Create data

```{r}
#| label: setup
#| include: false

library(tidyverse)
library(gt)

df <- tibble(rank=1:10, money=seq(100, 1000, 100))

```

# This renders successfully as html, almost successfully as pdf, and only partially as docx

-   as html everything looks correct

-   as pdf, the line break does not occur

-   as docx, the echoed code is shown but the table is not shown


```{r}

df %>% 
  gt() %>% 
  cols_label(rank=html("Rank"), money=md("Amount<br>$"))

```
